What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
Learning the syntax of javascript is fun. Narecall ko lahat ng tinuro noong CMSC 12, and its syntax is very easy to learn parang python lang. So far, sa lahat ng coding exercises, dito nalang ulit ako nag-enjoy at hindi na-stress. I feel driven and inspired while doing the exercise even though nagkaka errors sa una pero I'm happy I was able to fix them. <33
